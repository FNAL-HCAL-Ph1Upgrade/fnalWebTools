FNAL web tools
--------------

This repo contains some web-based tools that can be used through [the FNAL teststand's tomcat server](http://cmsnghcal01.fnal.gov:16000/). They could also be reused on a similar teststand.

FNAL also runs a modified version of webHandsaw, which can be found here:
https://github.com/HCALRunControl/logViewer/tree/fnal

TODO: Also contained here are the modified tomcat server configuration files for allowing simple cgi scripts to run in a tomcat server.

TODO: The layout for where all these files need to be deployed...
